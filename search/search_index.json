We are excited to resume the in-person School, but recognize the current COVID-19 situation and the added risks that in-person events bring. This page contains the COVID policies and plans for the School. The core principle is that we are all in this together . If we are careful and find a way to balance safety with academic and social interests, then we will have a successful event together. So it is up to each and every one of us to consider carefully our actions and the consequences on everyone. The information listed below applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. As a reminder, symptoms of COVID-19 include fatigue, congestion or runny nose, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, and/or loss of taste or smell. Additional information on COVID-19 symptoms can be found on the Center for Disease Control\u2019s website . Before Traveling to the School \u00b6 Points to consider the week leading up to the School: Try to minimize social contacts the week prior to the School, to reduce the chance that you contract COVID. Get a COVID test shortly before traveling. Ideally, do this the evening before or the morning of travel (or both, if you have extra tests). Rapid tests are best for this purpose, so that you have t\u200b\u200bhe result before leaving home. If you tested positive recently (past 2 weeks or so), you must get a negative test before coming to the School. If you test positive before the School and are therefore not cleared to travel, please let us know immediately. Most likely, we will arrange for remote participation via Zoom and Slack and will assist in canceling travel plans. We understand that no one wants this to happen, but please do not put others at risk by traveling or attending while sick. During Travel \u00b6 When actually traveling, from taking public transportation or a ride from a friend to the airport, in airports and other public places, on airplanes, and on the way to the hotel, we strongly recommend that you wear a mask to protect yourself and others. We know that masks are not required in all or most of those places, and there may be social pressure against wearing a mask, but it is still one of the best ways to avoid sickness. Most forms of travel mean that you are sharing air with people whose COVID status and precautions you cannot know. While in Madison \u00b6 Masks will be required at the School itself when indoors or in other poorly ventilated areas indicated by OSG School staff. When not in the School, consider wearing a mask when you are indoors and sharing airspace with others, regardless of local policy. People in Madison seem very tolerant of others wearing masks, so that should not be a problem. Dining is especially tricky. If eating with others or in a crowded indoor space, there is greater risk because masks are often removed while eating and talking. We encourage everyone to consider outdoor dining options when reasonable: For School meals, there are some outdoor tables and chairs at Union South (next to the School building). For evening meals, Madison has many restaurants that offer some outdoor dining space, or consider take-out and enjoy the many lovely outdoor spaces that downtown Madison and the UW campus offer. When outdoor dining is not possible (including School meals), spread out (> 2 meters) and try to avoid situations in which you are unmasked, facing others, and eating and talking. About Masks \u00b6 Use high-quality masks that fit you well, including N95, KN95, and other similar designations. Medical-grade masks are acceptable but simply not as good. We ask that participants bring their own masks, if possible, to ensure adequate supply and good fit. However, we do have a supply of KN95s available for people who cannot provide their own, but the kind we have may not fit you well. Cloth or other thin masks are not effective and should be avoided. If you have reasons for not being able to wear a high-quality mask during the School, please contact us as soon as possible and let\u2019s see what we can figure out together. If You Feel Sick or Should Quarantine While in Madison \u00b6 If you feel unwell or experience possible symptoms of COVID-19, or if you learn of close contact with someone who has just tested positive for COVID, please quarantine yourself away from the School and its participants and staff, and get a COVID test as soon as practical. See the box above: Yes, that unexplained headache could be an early symptom. Testing sites near the UW\u2013Madison campus include: CVS (2 South Bedford Street, Madison; 608-251-6047; PCR testing available; at-home test kits available for purchase) Walgreens (311 East Campus Mall, Madison; 608-251-0042; PCR testing is not available; at-home test kits are available for purchase) Additional PCR testing centers, including those with rapid turnaround times, can be found on the Public Health Madison & Dane County website If you have any questions about where and when to get tested, contact a healthcare representative or School staff (by email or Slack) When you can, (let School staff know)[mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org] why you are absent by email or Slack. Do not return to attending the School in-person until you feel better and have tested negative for COVID . Remote Attendance \u00b6 If you are in Madison and are sick or quarantined, or if you are not able to travel to Madison, we will support remote attendance to the best of our ability. We have learned a lot about remote events in the past 2 years! Some things we are planning: Stream lectures live over Zoom (and provide Zoom recordings afterward) Post all materials on this website Have a dedicated \u201conline\u201d staff member monitoring Zoom (when active), Slack, and email Being ready to organize consultations over Zoom Thus, as long as you feel up to it, we will support you during the School. If You Must Delay Your Departure from Madison \u00b6 If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Madison, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends isolating for a minimum of 5 days. OSG staff will assist you as best as possible with extending your lodging and rearranging travel plans, however, you will be financially responsible for all lodging, travel changes, food, and other expenses after your originally planned departure time. This is University policy and there is nothing we can do about it. Please review our recommendations and requirements above to make it more likely that you do not bring COVID with you or get it during travel and School activities! If you have any questions, concerns, or comments about these policies, do not hesitate to reach out to us at user-school@opensciencegrid.org or by DM on Slack.","title":"COVID policy"},{"location":"covid-policy/#covid-policy","text":"The OSG User School 2022 at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison welcomes participants from around the United States plus Mali and Uganda.

Even in the best of times, there is always the chance for travel issues \u2014 due to weather, mechanical issues, and so on. Lately, it seems that flight cancellations are even more common, so it is good to be prepared for last-minute changes. Below are some tips and ideas for dealing with travel. For concerns about COVID, before or during the event, please see our COVID page . Checking In Early \u00b6 Airlines generally allow you to check in for your flights the day before. Doing so may save you time and hassle at the airport on the day of travel. Go to your airline website and look for the \u201cCheck In\u201d section, then follow the steps. Finding Flight Status \u00b6 Be sure to check your flight status often, starting the day before travel begins. While you can check the status of each flight individually on the airline website (or a third-party site), you may be able to view your entire trip at once. Go to your airline website, find their section for \u201cMy Trips\u201d or something similar, and use the six-character \u201cConfirmation Number\u201d on your itinerary plus your last name to access your full itinerary, including flight status for each segment. Definitely check your flight status before leaving for the airport! Handling Flight Changes \u00b6 If the airlines make changes to your flights, see if you will still arrive at the School on time. Ideally, you arrive in Madison before about 6 p.m. on Sunday, July 24. If changes push your arrival later on Sunday, that is fine, just do your best to get here. If flight changes cause you to arrive later than Sunday, please let us know as soon as you can . Handling Flight Cancellations \u00b6 If one or more flights are cancelled, you will need to make new plans with the airlines. If Travel Incorporated made your travel arrangements, they can help in case of problems. Their contact information should have been on your itinerary confirmation, and we suggest saving it on your phone ahead of time. Travel Incorporated phone numbers Within the U.S.: +1 (877) 811-9898 Outside the U.S.: +1 (470) 589-2205 It may help to have our admin group code (UWMSN060222) handy, but this is not required. Note: If you call Travel Incorporated outside of their normal hours (7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Central Time weekdays), they will route your call to their after-hours service and charge us an extra $18 just to talk to a person. So while we want you to get the help you need, please consider other options (like your airline), too. If you are at an airport, it is a good idea to get in line at your airline\u2019s service counter; you can call the airline or Travel Inc. while waiting in line. Once you have contacted the airline or Travel Incorporated about any concerns and when you have time, please email us with any news especially if it changes your arrival day or time.","title":"Advice"},{"location":"logistics/travel-advice/#travel-advice","text":"This page offers some tips for traveling to and from the OSG User School.

We plan to email everyone about travel during the week of June 6\u201310, but are starting with a small group to fix any early issues. Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, please make sure that we get a copy of your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately. (If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will make a room reservation and pay for the six nights of the schedule.) Find the numbered section below that applies to you: 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel \u00b6 Our goal is to find reasonable and comfortable travel options for you to come to Madison and return home. At the same time, we must stay within our budget and follow all University of Wisconsin rules about arranging and paying for your travel costs. So let\u2019s work together to find something that makes sense for everyone. Here are a few ideas that have worked in the past to help some School travelers: If you are less than 300 miles from Madison, consider driving; we can reimburse mileage and tolls up to a point. Or look into bus routes, especially from larger cities like Chicago. If you fly, it may be much cheaper to fly to Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away), then take a direct bus to Madison. The buses are very comfortable, have wi-fi, and run frequently. Flying to Madison is the goal, but in some cases we will consider the fly-and-bus option. See below. Also if you fly, be flexible about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive. Now we do not like very early or very late flights any more than you do, so we will work hard to find reasonable flight times. Note: Please try to complete your travel plans by about June 20, before rates go up. Travel by Airplane \u00b6 Do NOT buy your own airline tickets . University rules say that our travel agency, Travel Incorporated, must buy your tickets. Use the following information to get air travel tickets: In the email that we sent you about arranging travel, click the link to Travel Incorporated\u2019s \u201cUWS Traveler Booking Form\u201d form (on smartsheet.com). You will need information on this page of tips to complete the form. We must review and approve most trips. Travel Inc can purchase tickets directly only in the easiest cases. But if the Travel Inc agent says that your trip must be reviewed, do not worry! It just means that we need to check the budget, options, and UW rules. We hope to approve your first choice, or we will work with you and Travel Inc to find another reasonable one. Common reasons for a trip needing review are: total trip cost over $600, travel starting and ending at different locations, and travel on dates other than July 24 and 30. Approval takes time, so it may take day or two to get confirmation. Airplane tickets cannot be held without purchase over a weekend, so avoid contacting Travel Inc late on Fridays. Please be considerate of the Travel Inc agent(s) you work with. They work hard to find good options for you, but they must also follow our rules. If you feel that they are not providing the options that you want, you should email us . We will help resolve any issues. Do not argue with the Travel Inc agents, especially about options you find online \u2014 there are many reasons why that option might not be available to us. Travel by Bus \u00b6 For some nearby locations, or in addition to air travel to Chicago or Milwaukee, it may be helpful to take a bus to Madison. Bus companies that School travelers have used a great deal in the past are: Van Galder Bus , especially from Chicago Badger Bus , especially from Milwaukee To get bus tickets, pick one method: Ask us to buy bus tickets for you in advance. This is the easiest option all around. Just email us at user-school@opensciencegrid.org ; include your desired travel dates (tickets are not specific by time), and start and end locations. Buy bus tickets for yourself. You may purchase bus tickets yourself before or on the day of travel. If you purchase your own tickets, you must get approval from the School for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the School. If you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email). It is best to have a detailed receipt (including your name, itinerary, date of purchase, and total amount paid), but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your name or date) should work fine. Just get what you can! Be sure to email us with your bus plans, including: Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus) Arrival date and approximate time Departure date and approximate time Arrival and departure location within Madison Actual or estimated cost (indicate which) Travel by Personal Car \u00b6 If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.585 per mile for the shortest round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in Madison (but not elsewhere). We recommend keeping your receipts for tolls. Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We reserve the right to limit your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details. To travel by personal car, please check with us first. We may search for comparable flight options, to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method. Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include: Departure date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison Departure date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above 2.

Calculating Fibonacci numbers \u2026 slowly \u00b6 The sample code for this exercise calculates the Fibonacci number resulting from a given set of iterations. Because this is a trival computation, the code includes a delay in each iteration through the main loop; this simulates a more intensive computation. To get set up: Log in to learn.chtc.wisc.edu ( login04 is fine, too, except the condor_ssh_to_job step below should be skipped) Create and change into a new directory for this exercise Download the Python script that is the main executable for this exercise: user@server $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osg-htc/user-school-2022/main/src/checkpointing/fibonacci.py If you want to run the script directly, make it executable first: user@server $ chmod 0755 fibonacci.py Take a look at the code, if you like. It is not very elegant, but it gets the job done. A few notes: The script takes a single argument, the number of iterations to run. To minimize computing time while leaving time to explore, 10 is a good number of iterations. The script checkpoints every other iteration through the main loop. The exit status code for a checkpoint is 85. It prints some output to standard out along the way, to let you know what is going on. The final result is written to a separate file named fibonacci.result . This file does not exist until the very end of the complete run. It is safe to run from the command line on an access point: user@server $ ./fibonacci.py 10 If you run it, what happens? (Due to the 30-second delay, be patient.) Can you explain its behavior? What happens if you run it again, without changing any files in between? Why? Preparing to run \u00b6 Now you have an executable and you know how to run it. It is time to prepare it for submission to HTCondor! Using what you know about the script (above), and using information in the slides from today, try writing a submit file that runs this software and implements exit-driven self-checkpointing. The Python code itself is ready and should not need any changes. Just use a plain queue statement, one job is enough to experiment on. Before you submit, read the next section first! Running and monitoring \u00b6 With the 30-second delay per iteration in the code and the suggested 10 iterations, once the script starts running you have about 5 minutes of runtime in which to see what is going on. So it may help to read through this section and then return here and submit your job. If your job has problems or finishes before you have the chance to do all the steps below, just remove the extra files (besides the Python script and your submit file) and try again! Submission and first checkpoint \u00b6 Submit the job Look at the contents of the submit directory \u2014 what changed? Start watching the log file: tail -n 100 -f YOUR-LOG-FILENAME.log Be patient! As HTCondor adds more lines to the end of your log file, they will appear automatically. Thus, nothing much will happen until HTCondor starts running your job. When it does, you will see three sets of messages in the log file quickly: Started transferring input files Finished transferring input files Job executing on host: (Of course, each message will contain a lot of other characters!) Now wait about 1 minute, and you should see two more messages appear: Started transferring output files Finished transferring output files That is the first checkpoint happening! Viewing the running job (only on learn ) \u00b6 Once you see those messages, let\u2019s look at the running job on the execute point ( note: these steps will work only on CHTC): Press Control-C ( Ctrl-c or ^C ) to exit the tail command Run condor_q to get the job ID of the running job Run condor_ssh_to_job JOB_ID , where you replace JOB_ID with your job ID from above Once you have logged in to the execute point, run some commands (somewhat quickly!): Where am I? hostname and then pwd What is here? Run ls -lF \u2014 is that what you expected? Do you see the fibonacci.checkpoint file? What is in it? Is that what you expected? Wait about 1 more minute and look at the checkpoint file again? Did it change? Run logout to leave the execute point and return to the access point As you may have guessed, condor_ssh_to_job logged you in to the execute point of your job and changed into its execute directory. You were looking at the job as it ran! Forcing your job to stop running \u00b6 Now, assuming that your job is still running (check condor_q again), you can force HTCondor to remove ( evict ) your job before it finishes: Run condor_q to get the job ID of the running job Run condor_vacate_job JOB_ID , where you replace JOB_ID with your job ID from above Monitor the action again by running tail -n 100 -f YOUR-LOG-FILENAME.log Finishing the job and wrap-up \u00b6 Be patient again! You removed your running job, and so HTCondor put it back in the queue as idle. If you wait a minute or two, you should see that HTCondor starts running the job again. In the log file, look carefully for the two Job executing on host: messages. Does it seem like you ran on the same computer again or on a different one? Both are possible! Let your job finish running this time. There should be a Job terminated of its own accord message near the end. Did you get results? Go through all the files and see what they contain. The log and output files are probably the most interesting. But did you get a result file, too? Did the output file \u2014 that is, whatever file you named in the output line of your submit file \u2014 contain everything that you expected it to? Conclusion \u00b6 This has been a brief and simple tour of self-checkpointing. If you would like to learn more, please read the Self-Checkpointing Applications section of the HTCondor Manual. Or talk to School staff about it. Or contact support@opensciencegrid.org for further help at any time.","title":"Exercise 1.1"},{"location":"materials/checkpoint/part1-ex1-checkpointing/#self-checkpointing-exercise-11-trying-it-out","text":"The goal of this exercise is to practice writing a submit file for self-checkpointing, and to see the process in action.","title":"Self-Checkpointing Exercise 1.1: Trying It Out"},{"location":"materials/checkpoint/part1-ex1-checkpointing/#calculating-fibonacci-numbers-slowly","text":"The sample code for this exercise calculates the Fibonacci number resulting from a given set of iterations.

If you have trouble getting SSH access to the submit server, ask the instructors right away! Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises. Logging In \u00b6 Today, you will use a submit server named learn.chtc.wisc.edu , which will allow you to submit jobs to our local HTCondor pool in CHTC. To log in, use a Secure Shell (SSH) client. From a Mac or Linux computer, run the Terminal app and use the ssh command, like so: # Change <USERNAME> to your username username@learn $ ssh <USERNAME>@learn.chtc.wisc.edu On Windows, we recommend a free client called PuTTY , but any SSH client should be fine. If you need help finding or using an SSH client, ask the instructors for help right away ! About Your Password \u00b6 Your mentor should have given you your username and password. If this is not true or you have lost the password, reach out to any staff member for help. While the passwd command will work (and will change your password temporarily), your initial password will be automatically reset for you on an hourly basis. So consider not changing your password and save the one provided in a secure place. Running Commands \u00b6 In the exercises, we will show commands that you are supposed to type or copy into the command line, like this: username@learn $ hostname learn.chtc.wisc.edu Note In the first line of the example above, the username@learn $ part is meant to show the Linux command-line prompt. You do not type this part! Further, your actual prompt probably is a bit different, and that is expected. So in the example above, the command that you type at your own prompt is just the eight characters hostname . The second line of the example, without the prompt, shows the output of the command; you do not type this part, either. Here are a few other commands that you can try (the examples below do not show the output from each command): username@learn $ whoami username@learn $ date username@learn $ uname -a A suggestion for the day: try typing into the command line as many of the commands as you can. Copy-and-paste is fine, of course, but you WILL learn more if you take the time to type each command yourself. Organizing Your Workspace \u00b6 You will be doing many different exercises over the next few days, many of them on this submit server. Each exercise may use many files, once finished. To avoid confusion, it may be useful to create a separate directory for each exercise. For instance, for the rest of this exercise, you may wish to create and use a directory named intro-1.1-login , or something like that. username@learn $ mkdir intro-1.1-login username@learn $ cd intro-1.1-login Showing the Version of HTCondor \u00b6 HTCondor is installed on this server. But what version? You can ask HTCondor itself: username@learn $ condor_version $ CondorVersion: 8 .9.8 Jun 29 2020 BuildID: 508520 PackageID: 8 .9.8-0.508520 $ $ CondorPlatform: x86_64_CentOS7 $ As you can see from the output, we are using HTCondor 8.9.8. FYI: Background information about HTCondor version numbers \u00b6 HTCondor always has two types of releases at one time: stable and development. HTCondor 8.6.x and 8.8.x are considered stable releases, indicated by even-numbered second digits (e.g., 6 or 8 in these cases). Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.6.0 and 8.6.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes. HTCondor 8.9.8 is the latest development release series of HTCondor. You know that these are a development release because the second digit (i.e., 9) is an odd number. CHTC is usually running the latest development series as the local CHTC Pool is somewhat of a final testing ground for new features. Other HTCondor pools and submit servers that you use outside of CHTC (including the OSG submit server you'll use later) may run different versions. In general, the user-facing HTCondor features in 8.6 forward are mostly the same, but you may see some differences in the format of output from condor_ commands or in more advanced or non-user features. Reference Materials \u00b6 Here are a few links to reference materials that might be interesting after the school (or perhaps during). HTCondor home page HTCondor manuals ; it is probably best to read the manual corresponding to the version of HTCondor that you use. That link points to the latest version of the manual, but you can switch versions using the toggle in the lower left corner of that page.

This first part of the exercise should take only a few minutes, and is designed to setup the next exercises. Bad Job \u00b6 Let\u2019s assume that a colleague has shared with you a program, and it fails once in a while. In the real world, we would probably just fix the program, but what if you cannot change the software? Unfortunately, this situation happens more often than we would like. Below is a Python script that fails once in a while. We will not fix it, but instead use it to simulate a program that can fail and that we cannot fix. #!/usr/bin/env python3 # murphy.py simulates a real program with real problems import random import sys import time # For one out of every three attempts, simulate a runtime error if random . randint ( 0 , 2 ) == 0 : # Intentionally don't print any output sys . exit ( 15 ) else : time . sleep ( 3 ) print ( \"All work done correctly\" ) # By convention, zero exit code means success sys . exit ( 0 ) Let\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor. In a new directory for this exercise, save the script above as murphy.py . Write a submit file for the script; queue 20 instances of the job and be sure to ask for 20 MB of memory and disk. Submit the file, note the ClusterId, and wait for the jobs to finish. What output do you expect? What output did you get? If you are curious about the exit code from the job, it is saved in completed jobs in condor_history in the ExitCode attribute. The following command will show the ExitCode for a given cluster of jobs: username@learn $ condor_history <CLUSTER> -af ProcId ExitCode (Be sure to replace <cluster> with your actual cluster ID. The command may take a minute or so to complete.) How many of the jobs succeeded? How many failed? Retrying Failed Jobs \u00b6 Now let\u2019s see if we can solve the problem of jobs that fail once in a while. In this particular case, if HTCondor runs a failed job again, it has a good chance of succeeding. Not all failing jobs are like this, but in this case it is a reasonable assumption. From the lecture materials, implement the max_retries feature to retry any job with a non-zero exit code up to 5 times, then resubmit the jobs. Did your change work? After the jobs have finished, examine the log file(s) to see what happened in detail. Did any jobs need to be restarted? Another way to see how many restarts there were is to look at the NumJobStarts attribute of a completed job with the condor_history command, in the same way you looked at the ExitCode attribute earlier. Does the number of retries seem correct? For those jobs which did need to be retried, what is their ExitCode ; and what about the ExitCode from earlier execution attempts? A (Too) Long Running Job \u00b6 Sometimes, an ill-behaved job will get stuck in a loop and run forever, instead of exiting with a failure code, and it may just need to be re-run (or run on a different execute server) to complete without getting stuck. We can modify our Python program to simulate this kind of bad job with the following file: #!/usr/bin/env python3 # murphy.py simulate a real program with real problems import random import sys import time # For one out of every three attempts, simulate an \"infinite\" loop if random . randint ( 0 , 2 ) == 0 : # Intentionally don't print any output time . sleep ( 3600 ) sys . exit ( 15 ) else : time . sleep ( 3 ) print ( \"All work done correctly\" ) # By convention, zero exit code means success sys . exit ( 0 ) Let\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor. Save the script to a new file named murphy2.py . Copy your previous submit file to a new name and change the executable to murphy2.py . If you like, submit the new file \u2014 but after a while be sure to remove the whole cluster to clear out the \u201chung\u201d jobs. Now try to change the submit file to automatically remove any jobs that run for more than one minute. You can make this change with just a single line in your submit file periodic_remove = (JobStatus == 2) && ( (CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > 60 ) Submit the new file. Do the long running jobs get removed? What does condor_history show for the cluster after all jobs are done? Which job status (i.e. idle, held, running) do you think JobStatus == 2 corresponds to?

They will be useful for monitoring your jobs and available slots (respectively) throughout the week. This exercise should take only a few minutes. Viewing Slots \u00b6 As discussed in the lecture, the condor_status command is used to view the current state of slots in an HTCondor pool. At its most basic, the command is very straightforward: username@learn $ condor_status This command, running on our (CHTC) pool, will produce a lot of output; there is one line per slot, and we typically have over 10,000 slots. TIP: You can widen your terminal window, which may help you to see all details of the output better. Here is some example output (what you see will be longer): slot1_31@e437.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Unclaimed Idle 0.000 8053 0+01:14:34 slot1_32@e437.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Unclaimed Idle 0.000 8053 0+03:57:00 slot1_33@e437.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Unclaimed Idle 0.000 8053 1+00:05:17 slot1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Owner Idle 0.300 250 7+03:22:21 slot1_1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Claimed Busy 0.930 1024 0+02:42:08 slot1_2@e438.chtc.wisc.edu LINUX X86_64 Claimed Busy 3.530 1024 0+02:40:24 This output consists of 8 columns: Col Example Meaning Name slot1_1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu Full slot name (including the hostname) OpSys LINUX Operating system Arch X86_64 Slot architecture (e.g., Intel 64 bit) State Claimed State of the slot ( Unclaimed is available, Owner is being used by the machine owner, Claimed is matched to a job) Activity Busy Is there activity on the slot? LoadAv 0.930 Load average, a measure of CPU activity on the slot Mem 1024 Memory available to the slot, in MB ActvtyTime 0+02:42:08 Amount of time spent in current activity (days + hours:minutes:seconds) At the end of the slot listing, there is a summary. Here is an example: Machines Owner Claimed Unclaimed Matched Preempting Drain X86_64/LINUX 10831 0 10194 631 0 0 6 X86_64/WINDOWS 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 Total 10833 2 10194 631 0 0 6 There is one row of summary for each machine (i.e. \"slot\") architecture/operating system combination with columns for the number of slots in each state. The final row gives a summary of slot states for the whole pool. Questions: \u00b6 When you run condor_status , how many 64-bit Linux slots are available? (Hint: Unclaimed = available.) What percent of the total slots are currently claimed by a job? (Note: there is a rapid turnover of slots, which is what allows users with new submission to have jobs start quickly.) How have these numbers changed (if at all) when you run the command again? Viewing Whole Machines, Only \u00b6 Also try out the -compact for a slightly different view of whole machines (i.e. server hostnames), without the individual slots shown. username@learn $ condor_status -compact How has the column information changed? Viewing Jobs \u00b6 The condor_q command lists jobs that are on this submit machine and that are running or waiting to run. The _q part of the name is meant to suggest the word \u201cqueue\u201d, or list of job sets waiting to finish. Viewing Your Own Jobs \u00b6 The default behavior of the command lists only your jobs: username@learn $ condor_q The main part of the output (which will be empty, because you haven't submitted jobs yet) shows one set (\"batch\") of submitted jobs per line.

This is a huge step in learning to use an HTC system! This exercise will take longer than the first two, short ones. It is the essential part of this exercise time. If you are having any problems getting the jobs to run, please ask the instructors! It is very important that you know how to run jobs. Running Your First Job \u00b6 Nearly all of the time, when you want to run an HTCondor job, you first write an HTCondor submit file for it. In this section, you will run the same hostname command as in Exercise 1.1, but where this command will run within a job on one of the 'execute' servers in CHTC's local HTCondor pool. Here is a straightforward submit file for the hostname command: executable = /bin/hostname output = hostname.out error = hostname.err log = hostname.log request_cpus = 1 request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 1MB queue Write those lines of text in a file named hostname.sub . Note There is nothing magic about the name of an HTCondor submit file. It can be any filename you want. It's a good practice to always include the .sub extension, but it is not required. Ultimately, a submit file is a text file The lines of the submit file have the following meanings: executable The name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit). output The filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job. error The filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job. log The filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. While not required, it is a really good idea to have a log file for every job. request_* Tells HTCondor how many cpus and how much memory and disk we want, which is not much, because the 'hostname' executable is very small. queue Tells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above. Note that we are not using the arguments or transfer_input_files lines that were mentioned during lecture because the hostname program is all that needs to be transferred from the submit server, and we want to run it without any additional options. Double-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job: username@learn $ condor_submit hostname.sub Submitting job(s). 1 job(s) submitted to cluster NNNN. The actual cluster number will be shown instead of NNNN . If, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file or ask for help. Notice that condor_submit returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does not wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes. View your job in the queue \u00b6 Now, use condor_q and condor_q -nobatch to watch for your job in the queue! You may not even catch the job in the R running state, because the hostname command runs very quickly. When the job itself is finished, it will 'leave' the queue and no longer be listed in the condor_q output. After the job finishes, check for the hostname output in hostname.out , which is where job information printed to the terminal screen will be printed for the job. username@learn $ cat hostname.out e171.chtc.wisc.edu The hostname.err file should be empty, unless there were issues running the hostname executable after it was transferred to the slot. The hostname.log is more complex and will be the focus of a later exercise. Running a Job With Arguments \u00b6 Very often, when you run a command on the command line, it includes arguments (i.e. options) after the program name, as in the below examples: username@learn $ cat hostname.out username@learn $ sleep 60 username@learn $ dc -e '6 7 * p' In an HTCondor submit file, the program (or 'executable') name goes in the executable statement and all remaining arguments go into an arguments statement. For example, if the full command is: username@learn $ sleep 60 Then in the submit file, we would put the location of the \"sleep\" program (you can find it with which sleep ) as the job executable , and 60 as the job arguments : executable = /bin/sleep arguments = 60 For the command-line command: username@learn $ dc -e '6 7 * p' We would put the following into the submit file, putting the arguments statement in quotes, since it contains single quotes: executable = /usr/bin/dc arguments = \"-e '6 7 * p'\" Let\u2019s try a job submission with arguments. We will use the sleep command shown above, which simply does nothing for the specified number of seconds, then exits normally. It is convenient for simulating a job that takes a while to run. Create a new submit file (you name it this time) and save the following text in it. executable = /bin/sleep arguments = 60 output = sleep.out error = sleep.err log = sleep.log request_cpus = 1 request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 1MB queue Except for changing a few filenames, this submit file is nearly identical to the last one. But, see the extra arguments line? Submit this new job. Again, watch for it to run using condor_q and condor_q -nobatch ; check once every 15 seconds or so. Once the job starts running, it will take about 1 minute to run (because of the sleep command, right?), so you should be able to see it running for a bit. When the job finishes, it will disappear from the queue, but there will be no output in the output or error files, because sleep does not produce any output. Running a Script Job From the Submit Directory \u00b6 So far, we have been running programs (executables) that come with the standard Linux system. More frequently, you will want to run a program that exists within your directory or perhaps a shell script of commands that you'd like to run within a job. In this example, you will write a shell script and a submit file that runs the shell script within a job: Put the following contents into a file named test-script.sh : #!/bin/sh echo 'Date: ' ` date ` echo 'Host: ' ` hostname ` echo 'System: ' ` uname -spo ` echo \"Program: $0 \" echo \"Args: $* \" echo 'ls: ' ` ls ` # END Add executable permissions to the file (so that it can be run as a program): username@learn $ chmod +x test-script.sh Test your script from the command line: username@learn $ ./test-script.sh hello 42 Date: Mon Jul 17 10:02:20 CDT 2017 Host: learn.chtc.wisc.edu System: Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux Program: ./test-script.sh Args: hello 42 ls: hostname.sub montage hostname.err hostname.log hostname.out test-script.sh This step is really important! If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. Further, debugging problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. So, if possible, test your executable and arguments as a command at the command-line first. Write the submit file (this should be getting easier by now): executable = test-script.sh arguments = foo bar baz output = script.out error = script.err log = script.log request_cpus = 1 request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 1MB queue In this example, the executable that was named in the submit file did not start with a / , so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file. Note Blank lines between commands and spaces around the = do not matter to HTCondor. For example, this submit file is equivalent to the one above: executable = test-script.sh arguments = foo bar baz output = script.out error = script.err log = script.log request_cpus=1 request_memory=1GB request_disk=1MB queue Use whitespace to make things clear to you . What format do you prefer to read? Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output (and error, which should be empty). What do you notice about the lines returned for \"Program\" and \"ls\"? Remember that only files pertaining to this job will be in the job working directory on the execute server. You're also seeing the effects of HTCondor's need to standardize some filenames when running your job, though they are named as you expect in the submission directory (per the submit file contents). Extra Challenge \u00b6 Note There are Extra Challenges throughout the school curriculum. You may be better off coming back to these after you've completed all other exercises for your current working session. Below is a Python script that does something similar to the shell script above.

If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. Further, debugging problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. So, if possible, test your executable and arguments as a command at the command-line first. Write the submit file (this should be getting easier by now): executable = test-script.sh arguments = foo bar baz output = script.out error = script.err log = script.log request_cpus = 1 request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 1MB queue In this example, the executable that was named in the submit file did not start with a / , so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file. Note Blank lines between commands and spaces around the = do not matter to HTCondor. For example, this submit file is equivalent to the one above: executable = test-script.sh arguments = foo bar baz output = script.out error = script.err log = script.log request_cpus=1 request_memory=1GB request_disk=1MB queue Use whitespace to make things clear to you . What format do you prefer to read? Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output (and error, which should be empty). What do you notice about the lines returned for \"Program\" and \"ls\"? Remember that only files pertaining to this job will be in the job working directory on the execute server. You're also seeing the effects of HTCondor's need to standardize some filenames when running your job, though they are named as you expect in the submission directory (per the submit file contents).","title":"Running a Script Job From the Submit Directory"},{"location":"materials/htcondor/part1-ex3-jobs/#extra-challenge","text":"Note There are Extra Challenges throughout the school curriculum.

This exercise is short, but you'll want to at least read over it before moving on (and come back later, if you can't run through it now). Reading a Log File \u00b6 For this exercise, we can examine a log file for any previous job that you have run. The example output below is based on the sleep 60 job. A job log file is updated throughout the life of a job, usually at key events. Each event starts with a heading that indicates what happened and when. Here are all of the event headings from the sleep job log (detailed output in between headings has been omitted here): 000 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:44:20 Job submitted from host: <128.104.100.43:9618?addrs=...> 040 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:10 Started transferring input files 040 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:10 Finished transferring input files 001 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:11 Job executing on host: <128.104.55.42:9618?addrs=...> 006 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:20 Image size of job updated: 72 040 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:20 Started transferring output files 040 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:45:20 Finished transferring output files 006 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:46:11 Image size of job updated: 4072 005 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:46:11 Job terminated.

Let\u2019s find out. Read through the entire procedure below before starting, because some parts of the process are time sensitive. Change the sleep job submit file, so that the job sleeps for 2 minutes (= 120 seconds) Submit the updated sleep job As soon as the condor_submit command finishes, hit the return key a few times, to create some blank lines Right away, run a command to show the log file and keep showing updates as they occur: username@learn $ tail -f sleep.log Watch the output carefully. When do events appear in the log file? After the termination event appears, press Control-C to end the tail command and return to the shell prompt. Understanding How HTCondor Writes Files \u00b6 When HTCondor writes the output, error, and log files, does it erase the previous contents of the file or does it add new lines onto the end? Let\u2019s find out! For this exercise, we can use the hostname job from earlier. Edit the hostname submit file so that it uses new and unique filenames for output, error, and log files. Alternatively, delete any existing output, error, and log files from previous runs of the hostname job. Submit the job three separate times in a row (there are better ways to do this, which we will cover in the next lecture) Wait for all three jobs to finish Examine the output file: How many hostnames are there? Did HTCondor erase the previous contents for each job, or add new lines? Examine the log file\u2026 carefully: What happened there? Pay close attention to the times and job IDs of the events.

There are three special resource request statements that you can use (optionally) in an HTCondor submit file: request_cpus for the number of CPUs your job will use (most softwares will take an argument to control this number, and it's usually otherwise \"1\") request_memory for the maximum amount of run-time memory your job may use request_disk for the maximum amount of disk space your job may use (including the executable and all other data that may show up during the job) HTCondor defaults to certain reasonable values for these request settings, so you do not need to use them to get small jobs to run. However, it is in YOUR best interest to always estimate resource requests before submitting any job, and to definitely tune your requests before submitting multiple jobs. In many HTCondor pools: If your job goes over the request values, it may be removed from the execute machine and held (status 'H' in the condor_q output, awaiting action on your part) without saving any partial job output files. So it is a disadvantage to not declare your resource needs or if you underestimate them. Conversely, if you overestimate them by too much, your jobs will match to fewer slots, with a longer average wait time. Additionally, by hogging up resources that you don't need, other users may be deprived of the resources they require. In the long run, it works better for all users of the pool if you declare what you really need. But how do you know what to request? In particular, we are concerned with memory and disk here; requesting multiple CPUs and using them is covered a bit in later school materials, but true HTC splits work up into jobs that each use as few CPU cores as possible (one CPU core is always best to have the most jobs running and completing soonest). Determining Resource Needs Before Running Any Jobs \u00b6 Note If you are running short on time, you can skip to \"Determining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs\", below, but try to come back and read over this part at some point. It can be very difficult to predict the memory needs of your running program without running tests. Typically, the memory size of a job changes over time, making the task even trickier. If you have knowledge ahead of time about your job\u2019s maximum memory needs, use that, or maybe a number that's just a bit higher, to be safe. Worst case scenario, you can request a fairly large amount of memory (as high as what's on your laptop or other server, if you know your program can run without crashing) for a first test job, OR you can run the program locally and 'watch' it: Examining a Running Program on a Local Computer \u00b6 When working on a shared submit server, you should not run computationally-intensive work because it can use resources needed by HTCondor to manage the queue for all uses. However, you may have access to other computers (your laptop, for example, or another server) where you can observe the memory usage of a program. The downside is that you'll have to watch a program run for essentially the entire time, to make sure you catch the maximum memory usage. For Memory: \u00b6 On Mac and Windows, for example, the \"Activity Monitor\" and \"Task Manager\" applications may be useful. On a Mac or Linux system, you can use the ps command or the top command in the Terminal to watch a running program and see (roughly) how much memory it is using. Full coverage of these tools is beyond the scope of this exercise, but here are two quick examples: Using ps : username@learn $ ps ux USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND cat 24342 0.0 0.0 90224 1864 ? S 13:39 0:00 sshd: cat@pts/0 cat 24343 0.0 0.0 66096 1580 pts/0 Ss 13:39 0:00 -bash cat 25864 0.0 0.0 65624 996 pts/0 R+ 13:52 0:00 ps ux cat 30052 0.0 0.0 90720 2456 ?

If your program runs long enough, you can run this command several times and note the greatest value. Using top : username@learn $ top -u <USERNAME> top - 13:55:31 up 11 days, 20:59, 5 users, load average: 0.12, 0.12, 0.09 Tasks: 198 total, 1 running, 197 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie Cpu(s): 1.2%us, 0.1%sy, 0.0%ni, 98.5%id, 0.2%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.1%si, 0.0%st Mem: 4001440k total, 3558028k used, 443412k free, 258568k buffers Swap: 4194296k total, 148k used, 4194148k free, 2960760k cached PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 24342 cat 15 0 90224 1864 1096 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.26 sshd 24343 cat 15 0 66096 1580 1232 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.07 bash 25927 cat 15 0 12760 1196 836 R 0.0 0.0 0:00.01 top 30052 cat 16 0 90720 2456 1112 S 0.0 0.1 0:00.69 sshd 30053 cat 18 0 66096 1624 1236 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.37 bash The top command (shown here with an option to limit the output to a single user ID) also shows information about running processes, but updates periodically by itself. Type the letter q to quit the interactive display. Again, the highlighted RES column shows an approximation of memory usage. For Disk: \u00b6 Determining disk needs may be a bit easier, because you can check on the size of files that a program is using while it runs. However, it is important to count all files that HTCondor counts to get an accurate size. HTCondor counts everything in your job sandbox toward your job\u2019s disk usage: The executable itself All \"input\" files (anything else that gets transferred TO the job, even if you don't think of it as \"input\") All files created during the job (broadly defined as \"output\"), including the captured standard output and error files that you list in the submit file. All temporary files created in the sandbox, even if they get deleted by the executable before it's done. If you can run your program within a single directory on a local computer (not on the submit server), you should be able to view files and their sizes with the ls and du commands. Determining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs (BEST) \u00b6 Despite the techniques mentioned above, by far the easiest approach to measuring your job\u2019s resource needs is to run one or a small number of sample jobs and have HTCondor itself tell you about the resources used during the runs. For example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running: #!/usr/bin/env python import time import os size = 1000000 numbers = [] for i in xrange ( size ): numbers . append ( str ( i )) tempfile = open ( 'numbers.txt' , 'w' ) tempfile . write ( ' ' . join ( numbers )) tempfile . close () time . sleep ( 60 ) Without trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, create a submit file for it, and run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more). When it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines: Partitionable Resources : Usage Request Allocated Cpus : 1 1 Disk (KB) : 6739 1048576 8022934 Memory (MB) : 3 1024 1024 So, now we know that HTCondor saw that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory! This is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results. And it never hurts to round up your resource requests a little, just in case your job occasionally uses more resources. Setting Resource Requirements \u00b6 Once you know your job\u2019s resource requirements, it is easy to declare them in your submit file. For example, taking our results above as an example, we might slightly increase our requests above what was used, just to be safe: # rounded up from 3 MB request_memory = 4MB # rounded up from 6.5 MB request_disk = 7MB Pay close attention to units: Without explicit units, request_memory is in MB (megabytes) Without explicit units, request_disk is in KB (kilobytes) Allowable units are KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), and TB (terabytes) HTCondor translates these requirements into attributes that become part of the job's requirements expression. However, do not put your CPU, memory, and disk requirements directly into the requirements expression; use the request_XXX statements instead. If you still have time in this working session, Add these requirements to your submit file for the Python script, rerun the job, and confirm in the log file that your requests were used. After changing the requirements in your submit file, did your job run successfully? If not, why? (Hint: HTCondor polls a job's resource use on a timer. How long are these jobs running for?)","title":"Exercise 1.5"},{"location":"materials/htcondor/part1-ex5-request/#htc-exercise-15-declare-resource-needs","text":"The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to test and tune the request_X statements in a submit file for when you don't know what resources your job needs.

Worst case scenario, you can request a fairly large amount of memory (as high as what's on your laptop or other server, if you know your program can run without crashing) for a first test job, OR you can run the program locally and 'watch' it:","title":"Determining Resource Needs Before Running Any Jobs"},{"location":"materials/htcondor/part1-ex5-request/#examining-a-running-program-on-a-local-computer","text":"When working on a shared submit server, you should not run computationally-intensive work because it can use resources needed by HTCondor to manage the queue for all uses.

For example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running: #!/usr/bin/env python import time import os size = 1000000 numbers = [] for i in xrange ( size ): numbers . append ( str ( i )) tempfile = open ( 'numbers.txt' , 'w' ) tempfile . write ( ' ' . join ( numbers )) tempfile . close () time . sleep ( 60 ) Without trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, create a submit file for it, and run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more). When it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines: Partitionable Resources : Usage Request Allocated Cpus : 1 1 Disk (KB) : 6739 1048576 8022934 Memory (MB) : 3 1024 1024 So, now we know that HTCondor saw that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory! This is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results.

For example, if some test jobs go on hold for using too much memory or disk, you may want to just remove them, edit the submit files, and then submit again.

It is mainly of interest to people who have their own C code to run (or C++, or really any compiled code, although Java would be handled a bit differently). Preparing a C Executable \u00b6 When preparing a C program for HTCondor, it is best to compile and link the executable statically, so that it does not depend on external libraries and their particular versions. Why is this important? When your compiled C program is sent to another machine for execution, that machine may not have the same libraries that you have on your submit machine (or wherever you compile the program). If the libraries are not available or are the wrong versions, your program may fail or, perhaps worse, silently produce the wrong results. Here is a simple C program to try using (thanks, Alain Roy): #include <stdio.h> int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { int sleep_time ; int input ; int failure ; if ( argc != 3 ) { printf ( \"Usage: simple <sleep-time> <integer> \\n \" ); failure = 1 ; } else { sleep_time = atoi ( argv [ 1 ]); input = atoi ( argv [ 2 ]); printf ( \"Thinking really hard for %d seconds... \\n \" , sleep_time ); sleep ( sleep_time ); printf ( \"We calculated: %d \\n \" , input * 2 ); failure = 0 ; } return failure ; } Save that code to a file, for example, simple.c . Compile the program with static linking: username@learn $ gcc -static -o simple simple.c As always, test that you can run your command from the command line first.

The main part of this exercise should take just a few minutes, but if you have more time later, come back and work on the extension ideas at the end to become a condor_q expert! Selecting Jobs \u00b6 The condor_q program has many options for selecting which jobs are listed. You have already seen that the default mode is to show only your jobs in \"batch\" mode: username@learn $ condor_q You've seen that you can view all jobs (all users) in the submit node's queue by using the -all argument: username@learn $ condor_q -all And you've seen that you can view more details about queued jobs, with each separate job on a single line using the -nobatch option: username@learn $ condor_q -nobatch username@learn $ condor_q -all -nobatch Did you know you can also name one or more user IDs on the command line, in which case jobs for all of the named users are listed at once? username@learn $ condor_q <USERNAME1> <USERNAME2> <USERNAME3> To list just the jobs associated with a single cluster number: username@learn $ condor_q <CLUSTER> For example, if you want to see the jobs in cluster 5678 (i.e., 5678.0 , 5678.1 , etc.), you use condor_q 5678 . To list a specific job (i.e., cluster.process, as in 5678.0): username@learn $ condor_q <JOB.ID> For example, to see job ID 5678.1, you use condor_q 5678.1 . Note You can name more than one cluster, job ID, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case jobs for all of the named clusters and/or job IDs are listed. Let\u2019s get some practice using condor_q selections! Using a previous exercise, submit several sleep jobs. List all jobs in the queue \u2014 are there others besides your own? Practice using all forms of condor_q that you have learned: List just your jobs, with and without batching. List a specific cluster. List a specific job ID. Try listing several users at once. Try listing several clusters and job IDs at once. When there are a variety of jobs in the queue, try combining a username and a different user's cluster or job ID in the same command \u2014 what happens? Viewing a Job ClassAd \u00b6 You may have wondered why it is useful to be able to list a single job ID using condor_q . By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful! If you add the -long option to condor_q (or its short form, -l ), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80\u201390 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like: username@learn $ condor_q -long <JOB.ID> The output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from condor_q output (except with some line breaks added to the Requirements attribute): MyType = \"Job\" Err = \"sleep.err\" UserLog = \"/home/cat/intro-2.1-queue/sleep.log\" Requirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) && ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) && ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) && ( TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk ) && ( TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory ) && ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer ) ClusterId = 2420 WhenToTransferOutput = \"ON_EXIT\" Owner = \"cat\" CondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\" Out = \"sleep.out\" Cmd = \"/bin/sleep\" Arguments = \"120\" Note Attributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time. Do not assume anything about the order of attributes in condor_q output. See what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job. Using a previous exercise, submit a sleep job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (180 seconds). Before the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file: condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt After the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt Now examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for: Can you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth) Can you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements) How many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of? DiskUsage ImageSize BytesSent JobStatus Why Is My Job Not Running? \u00b6 Sometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help. To ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the -better-analyze option to condor_q for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is: username@learn $ condor_q -better-analyze 2423 .0 Of course, replace the job ID with your own. Let\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use: executable = /bin/hostname output = norun.out error = norun.err log = norun.log should_transfer_files = YES when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT request_disk = 10MB request_memory = 8TB queue (Do you see what I did?) Save and submit this file. Run condor_q -better-analyze on the job ID. There is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with some lines omitted): -- Schedd: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.100.148:9618?... ... Job 98096.000 defines the following attributes: RequestDisk = 10240 RequestMemory = 8388608 The Requirements expression for job 98096.000 reduces to these conditions: Slots Step Matched Condition ----- -------- --------- [1] 11227 Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7 [9] 13098 TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk [11] 0 TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory No successful match recorded. Last failed match: Fri Jul 12 15:36:30 2019 Reason for last match failure: no match found 98096.000: Run analysis summary ignoring user priority. Of 710 machines, 710 are rejected by your job's requirements 0 reject your job because of their own requirements 0 match and are already running your jobs 0 match but are serving other users 0 are able to run your job ... At the end of the summary, condor_q provides a breakdown of how machines and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 710 total machines were considered above, and all of them were rejected based on my job's requirements . In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what? Further up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 13098 slots match our small disk request request, but none of the slots matched the TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory condition. The output also reports the value used for the RequestMemory attribute: my job asked for 8 terabytes of memory (8,388,608 MB) -- of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines. The output from condor_q -analyze (and condor_q -better-analyze ) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching. Bonus: Automatic Formatting Output \u00b6 Do this exercise only if you have time, though it's pretty awesome! There is a way to select the specific job attributes you want condor_q to tell you about with the -autoformat or -af option. In this case, HTCondor decides for you how to format the data you ask for from job ClassAd(s). (To tell HTCondor how to specially format this information, yourself, you could use the -format option, which we're not covering.) To use autoformatting, use the -af option followed by the attribute name, for each attribute that you want to output: username@learn $ condor_q -all -af Owner ClusterId Cmd moate 2418 /share/test.sh cat 2421 /bin/sleep cat 2422 /bin/sleep Bonus Question : If you wanted to print out the Requirements expression of a job, how would you do that with -af ? Is the output what you expected? (HINT: for ClassAd attributes like \"Requirements\" that are long expressions, instead of plain values, you can use -af:r to view the expressions, instead of what it's current evaluation.)

By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful! If you add the -long option to condor_q (or its short form, -l ), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80\u201390 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like: username@learn $ condor_q -long <JOB.ID> The output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from condor_q output (except with some line breaks added to the Requirements attribute): MyType = \"Job\" Err = \"sleep.err\" UserLog = \"/home/cat/intro-2.1-queue/sleep.log\" Requirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) && ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) && ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) && ( TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk ) && ( TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory ) && ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer ) ClusterId = 2420 WhenToTransferOutput = \"ON_EXIT\" Owner = \"cat\" CondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\" Out = \"sleep.out\" Cmd = \"/bin/sleep\" Arguments = \"120\" Note Attributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time. Do not assume anything about the order of attributes in condor_q output. See what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job. Using a previous exercise, submit a sleep job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (180 seconds). Before the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file: condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt After the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt Now examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for: Can you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth) Can you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you?

It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help. To ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the -better-analyze option to condor_q for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is: username@learn $ condor_q -better-analyze 2423 .0 Of course, replace the job ID with your own. Let\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use: executable = /bin/hostname output = norun.out error = norun.err log = norun.log should_transfer_files = YES when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT request_disk = 10MB request_memory = 8TB queue (Do you see what I did?) Save and submit this file. Run condor_q -better-analyze on the job ID. There is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with some lines omitted): -- Schedd: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.100.148:9618?... ... Job 98096.000 defines the following attributes: RequestDisk = 10240 RequestMemory = 8388608 The Requirements expression for job 98096.000 reduces to these conditions: Slots Step Matched Condition ----- -------- --------- [1] 11227 Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7 [9] 13098 TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk [11] 0 TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory No successful match recorded. Last failed match: Fri Jul 12 15:36:30 2019 Reason for last match failure: no match found 98096.000: Run analysis summary ignoring user priority. Of 710 machines, 710 are rejected by your job's requirements 0 reject your job because of their own requirements 0 match and are already running your jobs 0 match but are serving other users 0 are able to run your job ... At the end of the summary, condor_q provides a breakdown of how machines and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 710 total machines were considered above, and all of them were rejected based on my job's requirements . In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what? Further up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 13098 slots match our small disk request request, but none of the slots matched the TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory condition. The output also reports the value used for the RequestMemory attribute: my job asked for 8 terabytes of memory (8,388,608 MB) -- of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines. The output from condor_q -analyze (and condor_q -better-analyze ) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was.

The main part of this exercise should take just a few minutes, but if you have more time later, come back and work on the extension ideas at the end to become a condor_status expert! Selecting Slots \u00b6 The condor_status program has many options for selecting which slots are listed. You've already learned the basic condor_status and the condor_status -compact variation (which you may wish to retry now, before proceeding). Another convenient option is to list only those slots that are available now: username@learn $ condor_status -avail Of course, the individual execute machines only report their slots to the collector at certain time intervals, so this list will not reflect the up-to-the-second reality of all slots. But this limitation is true of all condor_status output, not just with the -avail option. Similar to condor_q , you can limit the slots that are listed in two easy ways. To list just the slots on a specific machine: username@learn $ condor_status <hostname> For example, if you want to see the slots on e2337.chtc.wisc.edu (in the CHTC pool): username@learn $ condor_status e2337.chtc.wisc.edu To list a specific slot on a machine: username@learn $ condor_status <slot>@<hostname> For example, to see the \u201cfirst\u201d slot on the machine above: username@learn $ condor_status slot1@e2337.chtc.wisc.edu Note You can name more than one hostname, slot, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case slots for all of the named hostnames and/or slots are listed. Let\u2019s get some practice using condor_status selections! List all slots in the pool \u2014 how many are there total? Practice using all forms of condor_status that you have learned: List the available slots. List the slots on a specific machine (e.g., e2337.chtc.wisc.edu ). List a specific slot from that machine. Try listing the slots from a few (but not all) machines at once. Try using a mix of hostnames and slot IDs at once. Viewing a Slot ClassAd \u00b6 Just as with condor_q , you can use condor_status to view the complete ClassAd for a given slot (often confusingly called the \u201cmachine\u201d ad): username@learn $ condor_status -long <slot>@<hostname> Because slot ClassAds may have 150\u2013200 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single slot at a time, as shown above. Here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from condor_status output: OpSys = \"LINUX\" DetectedCpus = 24 OpSysAndVer = \"SL6\" MyType = \"Machine\" LoadAvg = 0.99 TotalDisk = 798098404 OSIssue = \"Scientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon)\" TotalMemory = 24016 Machine = \"e242.chtc.wisc.edu\" CondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\" Memory = 1024 As you may be able to tell, there is a mix of attributes about the machine as a whole (hence the name \u201cmachine ad\u201d) and about the slot in particular. Go ahead and examine a machine ClassAd now. I suggest looking at one of the slots on, say, e2337.chtc.wisc.edu because of its relatively simple configuration. Viewing Slots by ClassAd Expression \u00b6 Often, it is helpful to view slots that meet some particular criteria. For example, if you know that your job needs a lot of memory to run, you may want to see how many high-memory slots there are and whether they are busy. You can filter the list of slots like this using the -constraint option and a ClassAd expression. For example, suppose we want to list all slots that are running Scientific Linux 7 (operating system) and have at least 16 GB memory available. Note that memory is reported in units of Megabytes. The command is: username@learn $ condor_status -constraint 'OpSysAndVer == \"CentOS7\" && Memory >= 16000' Note Be very careful with using quote characters appropriately in these commands. In the example above, the single quotes ( ' ) are for the shell, so that the entire expression is passed to condor_status untouched, and the double quotes ( \" ) surround a string value within the expression itself. Currently on CHTC, there are only a few slots that meet these criteria (our high-memory servers, mainly used for metagenomics assemblies). If you are interested in learning more about writing ClassAd expressions, look at section 4.1 and especially 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual. This is definitely advanced material, so if you do not want to read it, that is fine. But if you do, take some time to practice writing expressions for the condor_status -constraint command. Note The condor_q command accepts the -constraint option as well! As you might expect, the option allows you to limit the jobs that are listed based on a ClassAd expression. Bonus: Formatting Output \u00b6 The condor_status command accepts the same -autoformat ( -af ) options that condor_q accepts, and the options have the same meanings in both commands. Of course, the attributes available in machine ads may differ from the ones that are available in job ads. Use the HTCondor Manual or look at individual slot ClassAds to get a better idea of what attributes are available. For example, I was curious about the host name and operating system of the slots with more than 32GB of memory: username@learn $ condor_status -af Machine -af OpSysAndVer -constraint 'Memory >= 32000' If you like, spend a few minutes now or later experimenting with condor_status formatting.

This small change significantly adds to the kinds of jobs that you can run. Viewing a Job Sandbox \u00b6 Before you learn to transfer files to and from your job, it is good to understand a bit more about the environment in which your job runs. When the HTCondor starter process prepares to run your job, it creates a new directory for your job and all of its files. We call this directory the job sandbox , because it is your job\u2019s private space to play. Let\u2019s see what is in the job sandbox for a minimal job with no special input or output files. Save the script below in a file named sandbox.sh : #!/bin/sh echo 'Date: ' ` date ` echo 'Host: ' ` hostname ` echo 'Sandbox: ' ` pwd ` ls -alF # END Create a submit file for this script and submit it. When the job finishes, look at the contents of the output file. In the output file, note the Sandbox: line: That is the full path to your job sandbox for the run. It was created just for your job, and it was removed as soon as your job finished. Next, look at the output that appears after the Sandbox: line; it is the output from the ls command in the script. It shows all of the files in your job sandbox, as they existed at the end of the execution of sandbox.sh . The files are: .chirp.config Configuration for an advanced feature .job.ad The job ClassAd .machine.ad The machine ClassAd _condor_stderr Saved standard error from the job _condor_stdout Saved standard output from the job condor_exec.exe The executable, renamed from sandbox.sh tmp/ , var/tmp/ Directories in which to put temporary files So, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable ( sandbox.sh ), renamed it ( condor_exec.exe ), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was not transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file. Now that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it. Running a Job With Input Files \u00b6 Next, you will run a job that requires an input file. Remember, the initial job sandbox will contain only the renamed job executable, unless you tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file that needs to be transferred. Fortunately, this is easy. Here is a Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts. #!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys if len ( sys . argv ) != 2 : print 'Usage: %s DATA' % ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) sys . exit ( 1 ) input_filename = sys . argv [ 1 ] words = {} my_file = open ( input_filename , 'r' ) for line in my_file : word = line . strip () . lower () if word in words : words [ word ] += 1 else : words [ word ] = 1 my_file . close () for word in sorted ( words . keys ()): print ' %8d %s ' % ( words [ word ], word ) Save the Python script in a file named freq.py . Download the input file for the script (263K lines, ~1.4 MB) and save it in your submit directory: username@learn $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool20/intro-2.1-words.txt Create a submit file for the freq.py executable. Add a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file: transfer_input_files = intro-2.1-words.txt As with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes, as long as it comes before the word queue . Do not forget to add a line to name the input file as the argument to the Python script. Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output! If things do not work the first time, keep trying! At this point in the exercises, we are telling you less and less explicitly how to do steps that you have done before. If you get stuck, ask for help in the #intro-to-htc Slack channel. Note If you want to transfer more than one input file, list all of them on a single transfer_input_files command, separated by commas. For example, if there are three input files: transfer_input_files = a.txt, b.txt, c.txt Transferring Output Files \u00b6 So far, we have relied on programs that send their output to the standard output and error streams, which HTCondor captures, saves, and returns back to the submit directory. But what if your program writes one or more files for its output? How do you tell HTCondor to bring them back? Let\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a job creates in the sandbox. We will use a very simple method for creating a new file: we will copy an input file to another name. Find or create a small input file (it is fine to use any small file from a previous exercise). Create a submit file that transfers the input file and copies it to another name (as if doing /bin/cp input.txt output.txt on the command line) Make the output filename different than any filenames that are in your submit directory What is the executable line? What is the arguments line? How do you tell HTCondor to transfer the input file? As always, use output , error , and log filenames that are different from previous exercises Submit the job and wait for it to finish. What happened? Can you tell what HTCondor did with the output file that was created (did it end up back on the submit server?), after it was created in the job sandbox? Look carefully at the list of files in your submit directory now. Transferring Specific Output Files \u00b6 As you saw in the last exercise, by default HTCondor transfers files that are created in the job sandbox back to the submit directory when the job finishes. In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back changed input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and not for ones contained in subdirectories. What if you want to bring back only some output files, or output files contained in subdirectories? Here is a shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory: #!/bin/sh if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then echo \"Usage: $0 INPUT\" ; exit 1 ; fi date > output-timestamp.txt cal > output-calendar.txt mkdir subdirectory cp $1 subdirectory/backup- $1 First, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory: Save the shell script in a file named output.sh . Write a submit file that transfers an input file and runs output.sh on it (passing the filename as an argument). Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory. Suppose you decide that you want only the timestamp output file and all files in the subdirectory, but not the calendar output file. You can tell HTCondor to transfer these specific files: transfer_output_files = output-timestamp.txt, subdirectory/ Note See the trailing slash ( / ) on the subdirectory? That tells HTCondor to transfer back the files contained in the subdirectory, but not the directory itself; the files will be written directly into the submit directory. If you want HTCondor to transfer back an entire directory, leave off the trailing slash. Remove all output files from the previous run, including output-timestamp.txt and output-calendar.txt . Copy the previous submit file that ran output.sh and add the transfer_output_files line from above. Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory. Did it work as you expected? Thinking About Progress So Far \u00b6 At this point, you can do just about everything that you need in order to run jobs on a local HTC pool. You can identify the executable, arguments, and input files, and you can get output back from the job. This is a big achievement! In some ways, everything after this exercise shows you how to submit multiple jobs at once and makes it easier to run certain kinds of jobs and deal with certain kinds of situations.

The files are: .chirp.config Configuration for an advanced feature .job.ad The job ClassAd .machine.ad The machine ClassAd _condor_stderr Saved standard error from the job _condor_stdout Saved standard output from the job condor_exec.exe The executable, renamed from sandbox.sh tmp/ , var/tmp/ Directories in which to put temporary files So, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable ( sandbox.sh ), renamed it ( condor_exec.exe ), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was not transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file. Now that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it.","title":"Viewing a Job Sandbox"},{"location":"materials/htcondor/part2-ex1-files/#running-a-job-with-input-files","text":"Next, you will run a job that requires an input file. Remember, the initial job sandbox will contain only the renamed job executable, unless you tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file that needs to be transferred. Fortunately, this is easy. Here is a Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts. #!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys if len ( sys . argv ) != 2 : print 'Usage: %s DATA' % ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) sys . exit ( 1 ) input_filename = sys . argv [ 1 ] words = {} my_file = open ( input_filename , 'r' ) for line in my_file : word = line . strip () . lower () if word in words : words [ word ] += 1 else : words [ word ] = 1 my_file . close () for word in sorted ( words . keys ()): print ' %8d %s ' % ( words [ word ], word ) Save the Python script in a file named freq.py .

Add a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file: transfer_input_files = intro-2.1-words.txt As with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes, as long as it comes before the word queue . Do not forget to add a line to name the input file as the argument to the Python script. Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output! If things do not work the first time, keep trying! At this point in the exercises, we are telling you less and less explicitly how to do steps that you have done before. If you get stuck, ask for help in the #intro-to-htc Slack channel.

But what if your program writes one or more files for its output? How do you tell HTCondor to bring them back? Let\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a job creates in the sandbox. We will use a very simple method for creating a new file: we will copy an input file to another name. Find or create a small input file (it is fine to use any small file from a previous exercise). Create a submit file that transfers the input file and copies it to another name (as if doing /bin/cp input.txt output.txt on the command line) Make the output filename different than any filenames that are in your submit directory What is the executable line? What is the arguments line? How do you tell HTCondor to transfer the input file? As always, use output , error , and log filenames that are different from previous exercises Submit the job and wait for it to finish. What happened?

In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back changed input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and not for ones contained in subdirectories. What if you want to bring back only some output files, or output files contained in subdirectories? Here is a shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory: #!/bin/sh if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then echo \"Usage: $0 INPUT\" ; exit 1 ; fi date > output-timestamp.txt cal > output-calendar.txt mkdir subdirectory cp $1 subdirectory/backup- $1 First, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory: Save the shell script in a file named output.sh . Write a submit file that transfers an input file and runs output.sh on it (passing the filename as an argument). Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory. Suppose you decide that you want only the timestamp output file and all files in the subdirectory, but not the calendar output file. You can tell HTCondor to transfer these specific files: transfer_output_files = output-timestamp.txt, subdirectory/ Note See the trailing slash ( / ) on the subdirectory? That tells HTCondor to transfer back the files contained in the subdirectory, but not the directory itself; the files will be written directly into the submit directory. If you want HTCondor to transfer back an entire directory, leave off the trailing slash. Remove all output files from the previous run, including output-timestamp.txt and output-calendar.txt .

Suppose you have a program that you want to run many times with different arguments each time. With what you know so far, you have a couple of choices: Write one submit file; submit one job, change the argument in the submit file, submit another job, change the submit file, \u2026 Write many submit files that are nearly identical except for the program argument Neither of these options seems very satisfying. Fortunately, we can do better with HTCondor. Running Many Jobs With One queue Statement \u00b6 Here is a C program that uses a stochastic (random) method to estimate the value of \u03c0 \u2014 feel free to try to figure out the method from the code, but it is not critical for this exercise. The single argument to the program is the number of samples to take. More samples should result in better estimates! #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/time.h> int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { struct timeval my_timeval ; int iterations = 0 ; int inside_circle = 0 ; int i ; double x , y , pi_estimate ; gettimeofday ( & my_timeval , NULL ); srand48 ( my_timeval . tv_sec ^ my_timeval . tv_usec ); if ( argc == 2 ) { iterations = atoi ( argv [ 1 ]); } else { printf ( \"usage: circlepi ITERATIONS \\n \" ); exit ( 1 ); } for ( i = 0 ; i < iterations ; i ++ ) { x = ( drand48 () - 0.5 ) * 2.0 ; y = ( drand48 () - 0.5 ) * 2.0 ; if ((( x * x ) + ( y * y )) <= 1.0 ) { inside_circle ++ ; } } pi_estimate = 4.0 * (( double ) inside_circle / ( double ) iterations ); printf ( \"%d iterations, %d inside; pi = %f \\n \" , iterations , inside_circle , pi_estimate ); return 0 ; } In a new directory for this exercise, save the code to a file named circlepi.c Compile the code (we will cover this in more detail during the Software lecture): username@learn $ gcc -static -o circlepi circlepi.c Test the program with just 1000 samples: username@learn $ ./circlepi 1000 Now suppose that you want to run the program many times, to produce many estimates. To do so, we can tell HTCondor how many jobs to \"queue up\" via the queue statement we've been putting at the end of each of our submit files. Let\u2019s see how it works: Write a normal submit file for this program Pass 1 million ( 1000000 ) as the command line argument to circlepi Make sure to include log , output , and error (with filenames like circlepi.log ), and request_* lines At the end of the file, write queue 3 instead of just queue (\"queue 3 jobs\" vs. \"queue a job\"). Submit the file. Note the slightly different message from condor_submit : 3 job(s) submitted to cluster *NNNN*. Before the jobs execute, look at the job queue to see the multiple jobs Here is some sample condor_q -nobatch output: ID OWNER SUBMITTED RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD 10228.0 cat 7/25 11:57 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.7 circlepi 1000000000 10228.1 cat 7/25 11:57 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.7 circlepi 1000000000 10228.2 cat 7/25 11:57 0+00:00:00 I 0 0.7 circlepi 1000000000 In this sample, all three jobs are part of cluster 10228 , but the first job was assigned process 0 , the second job was assigned process 1 , and the third one was assigned process 2 . (Programmers like to start counting from 0.) Now we can understand what the first column in the output, the job ID , represents. It is a job\u2019s cluster number, a dot ( . ), and the job\u2019s process number. So in the example above, the job ID of the second job is 10228.1 . Pop Quiz: Do you remember how to ask HTCondor to list all of the jobs from one cluster? How about one specific job ID? Using queue N With Output \u00b6 When all three jobs in your single cluster are finished, examine the resulting files. What is in the output file? What is in the error file (hopefully nothing)? What is in the log file? Look carefully at the job IDs in each event. Is this what you expected? Is it what you wanted? Using $(Process) to Distinguish Jobs \u00b6 As you saw with the experiment above, each job ended up overwriting the same output and error filenames in the submission directory. After all, we didn't tell it to behave any differently when it ran three jobs. We need a way to separate output (and error) files per job that is queued , not just for the whole cluster of jobs. Fortunately, HTCondor has a way to separate the files easily. When processing a submit file, HTCondor will replace any instance of $(Process) with the process number of the job, for each job that is queued. For example, you can use the $(Process) variable to define a separate output file name for each job: output = my-output-file-$(Process).out queue 10 Even though the output filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job: First job my-output-file-0.out Second job my-output-file-1.out Third job my-output-file-2.out ... ... Last (tenth) job my-output-file-9.out Let\u2019s see how this works for our program that estimates \u03c0. In your submit file, change the definitions of output and error to use $(Process) in the filename, similar to the example above. Delete any output, error, and log files from previous runs. Submit the updated file. When all three jobs are finished, examine the resulting files again. How many files are there of each type? What are their names? Is this what you expected? Is it what you wanted from the \u03c0 estimation process? Using $(Cluster) to Separate Files Across Runs \u00b6 With $(Process) , you can get separate output (and error) filenames for each job within a run. However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well. In addition to $(Process) , there is also a $(Cluster) variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like $(Process) , except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used with $(Process) , it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this output statement: output = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out For one particular run, it might result in output filenames like my-output-file-2444-0.out , myoutput-file-2444-1.out , myoutput-file-2444-2.out , etc. However, the next run would have different filenames, replacing 2444 with the new Cluster number of that run. Using $(Process) and $(Cluster) in Other Statements \u00b6 The $(Cluster) and $(Process) variables can be used in any submit file statement, although they are useful in some kinds of submit file statements and not really for others. For example, consider using $(Cluster) or $(Process) in each of the below: log transfer_input_files transfer_output_files arguments Unfortunately, HTCondor does not easily let you perform math on the $(Process) number when using it. So, for example, if you use $(Process) as a numeric argument to a command, it will always result in jobs getting the arguments 0, 1, 2, and so on. If you have control over your program and the way in which it uses command-line arguments, then you are fine. Otherwise, you might need a solution like those in the next exercises. (Optional) Defining JobBatchName for Tracking \u00b6 During the lecture, it was mentioned that you can define arbitrary attributes in your submit file, and that one purpose of such attributes is to track or report on different jobs separately. In this optional exercise, you will see how this technique can be used. Once again, we will use sleep jobs, so that your jobs remain in the queue long enough to experiment on. Create a submit file that runs sleep 120 (or some reasonable duration). Instead of a single queue statement, write this: jobbatchname = 1 queue 5 Submit the file. Now, quickly edit the submit file to instead say: jobbatchname = 2 Submit the file again. Check on the submissions using a normal condor_q and condor_q -nobatch . Of course, your special attribute does not appear in the condor_q -nobatch output, but it is present in the condor_q output and in each job\u2019s ClassAd. You can see the effect of the attribute by limiting your condor_q output to one type of job or another. First, run this command: username@learn $ condor_q -constraint 'JobBatchName == \"1\"' Do you get the output that you expected? Using the example command above, how would you list your other five jobs?

The goal of this exercise is to submit many jobs from a single submit file by using the queue ... from syntax to read variable values from a file. In all cases of submitting many jobs from a single submit file, the key questions are: What makes each job unique? In other words, there is one job per _____? So, how should you tell HTCondor to distinguish each job? For queue *N* , jobs are distinguished simply by the built-in \"process\" variable. But with the remaining queue forms, you help HTCondor distinguish jobs by other, more meaningful custom variables. Counting Words in Files \u00b6 Imagine you have a collection of books, and you want to analyze how word usage varies from book to book or author to author. As mentioned in the lecture, HTCondor provides many ways to submit jobs for this task. You could create a separate submit file for each book, and submit all of the files manually, but you'd have a lot of file lines to modify each time (in particular, all five of the last lines before queue below): executable = freq.py request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 20MB should_transfer_files = YES when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT transfer_input_files = AAiW.txt arguments = AAiW.txt output = AAiW.out error = AAiW.err log = AAiW.log queue This would be overly verbose and tedious. Let's do better. Queue Jobs From a List of Values \u00b6 Suppose we want to modify our word-frequency analysis from a previous exercise so that it outputs only the most common N words of a document. However, we want to experiment with different values of N . For this analysis, we will have a new version of the word-frequency counting script. First, we need a new version of the word counting program so that it accepts an extra number as a command line argument and outputs only that many of the most common words. Here is the new code (it's still not important that you understand this code): #!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys import operator if len ( sys . argv ) != 3 : print 'Usage: %s DATA NUM_WORDS' % ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) sys . exit ( 1 ) input_filename = sys . argv [ 1 ] num_words = int ( sys . argv [ 2 ]) words = {} my_file = open ( input_filename , 'r' ) for line in my_file : line_words = line . split () for word in line_words : if word in words : words [ word ] += 1 else : words [ word ] = 1 my_file . close () sorted_words = sorted ( words . items (), key = operator . itemgetter ( 1 )) for word in sorted_words [ - num_words :]: print ' %s %8d ' % ( word [ 0 ], word [ 1 ]) To submit this program with a collection of two variable values for each run, one for the number of top words and one for the filename: Save the script as wordcount-top-n.py . Download and unpack some books from Project Gutenberg: username@learn $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool20/books.zip username@learn $ unzip books.zip Create a new submit file (or base it off a previous one!) named wordcount-top.sub , including memory and disk requests of 20 MB. All of the jobs will use the same executable and log statements. Update other statements to work with two variables, book and n : output = $(book)_top_$(n).out error = $(book)_top_$(n).err transfer_input_files = $(book) arguments = \"$(book) $(n)\" queue book,n from books_n.txt Note especially the changes to the queue statement; it now tells HTCondor to read a separate text file of pairs of values, which will be assigned to book and n respectively.

Counting Words in Files \u00b6 Returning to our book word-counting example, let's pretend that instead of three books, we have an entire library. While we could list all of the text files in a books.txt file and use queue book from books.txt , it could be a tedious process, especially for tens of thousands of files. Luckily HTCondor provides a mechanism for submitting jobs based on pattern-matched files. Queue Jobs By Matching Filenames \u00b6 This is an example of a common scenario: We want to run one job per file, where the filenames match a certain consistent pattern. The queue ... matching statement is made for this scenario. Let\u2019s see this in action. First, here is a new version of the script (note, we removed the 'top n words' restriction): #!/usr/bin/env python import os import sys import operator if len ( sys . argv ) != 2 : print 'Usage: %s DATA' % ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) sys . exit ( 1 ) input_filename = sys . argv [ 1 ] words = {} my_file = open ( input_filename , 'r' ) for line in my_file : line_words = line . split () for word in line_words : if word in words : words [ word ] += 1 else : words [ word ] = 1 my_file . close () sorted_words = sorted ( words . items (), key = operator . itemgetter ( 1 )) for word in sorted_words : print ' %s %8d ' % ( word [ 0 ], word [ 1 ]) To use the script: Save it as wordcount.py . Verify the script by running it on one book manually. Create a new submit file to submit one job (pick a book file and model your submit file off of the one above) Modify the following submit file statements to work for all books: transfer_input_files = $(book) arguments = $(book) output = $(book).out error = $(book).err queue book matching *.txt Note As always, the order of statements in a submit file does not matter, except that the queue statement should be last. Also note that any submit file variable name (here, book , but true for process and all others) may be used in any mixture of upper- and lowercase letters. Submit the jobs. HTCondor uses the queue ... matching statement to look for files in the submit directory that match the given pattern, then queues one job per match. For each job, the given variable (e.g., book here) is assigned the name of the matching file, so that it can be used in output , error , and other statements. The result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file: ... transfer_input_files = AAiW.txt arguments = \"AAiW.txt\" output = AAiW.txt.out error = AAiW.txt.err queue transfer_input_files = PandP.txt arguments = \"PandP.txt\" output = PandP.txt.out error = PandP.txt.err queue transfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt arguments = \"TAoSH.txt\" output = TAoSH.txt.out error = TAoSH.txt.err queue ...

This exercise should take 10-15 minutes. Background \u00b6 This is the simplest scenario for using a particular software program on the Open Science Grid - downloading a pre-compiled binary and using it to run jobs. Our Software Example \u00b6 The software we will be using for this example is a common tool for aligning genome and protein sequences against a reference database, the BLAST program. Search the internet for the BLAST software. Searches might include \"blast executable or \"download blast software\". Hopefully these searches will lead you to a BLAST website page that looks like this: Click on the title that says \"Download BLAST\" and then look for the link that has the latest installation and source code . You should end up on a page with a list of each version of BLAST that is available for different operating systems. We could download the source and compile it ourselves, but instead, we're going to use one of the pre-built binaries. Before proceeding, look at the list of downloads and try to determine which one you want. Based on our operating system, we want to use the Linux binary, which is labelled with the x64-linux suffix. All the other links are either for source code or other operating systems. While logged into login04.osgconnect.net , create a directory for this exercise.

Where is it in the directory you just decompressed? Copy the Input Files \u00b6 To run BLAST, we need an input file and reference database. For this example, we'll use the \"pdbaa\" database, which contains sequences for the protein structure from the Protein Data Bank. For our input file, we'll use an abbreviated fasta file with mouse genome information. Download these files to your current directory: username@login $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool21/pdbaa.tar.gz username@login $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool21/mouse.fa Untar the pdbaa database: username@login $ tar -xzf pdbaa.tar.gz Submitting the Job \u00b6 We now have our program (the pre-compiled blastx binary) and our input files, so all that remains is to create the submit file. The form of a typical blastx command looks something like this: blastx -db <database_dir/prefix> -query <input_file> -out <output_file> Copy a submit file from one of the Day 2 exercises to use for this exercise. Think about which lines you will need to change or add to your submit file in order to submit the job successfully. In particular: What is the executable?

Once you have done all you can, check your submit file against the lines below, which contain the exact components to run this particular job.

Background \u00b6 Wrapper scripts are a useful tool for running software that can't be compiled into one piece, needs to be installed with every job, or just for running extra steps. A wrapper script can either install the software from the source code, or use an already existing software (as in this exercise). Not only does this portability technique work with almost any kind of software that can be locally installed, it also allows for a great deal of control and flexibility for what happens within your job. Once you can write a script to handle your software (and often your data as well), you can submit a large variety of workflows to a distributed computing system like the Open Science Grid. For this exercise, we will write a wrapper script as an alternate way to run the same job as the previous exercise. Wrapper Script, part 1 \u00b6 Our wrapper script will be a bash script that runs several commands. In the same directory as the last exercise (still logged into login04.osgconnect.net ) make a file called run_blast.sh . The first line we'll place in the script is the basic command for running blast. Based on our previous submit file, what command needs to go into the script? Once you have an idea, check against the example below: #!/bin/bash ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin/blastx -db pdbaa/pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out results.txt Note The \"header\" of #!/bin/bash will tell the computer that this is a bash shell script and can be run in the same way that you would run individual commands on the command line. Submit File Changes \u00b6 We now need to make some changes to our submit file. Make a copy of your previous submit file and open it to edit. Since we are now using a wrapper script, that will be our job's executable. Replace the original blastx exeuctable with the name of our wrapper script and comment out the arguments line. executable = run_blast.sh #arguments = Note that since the blastx program is no longer listed as the executable, it will be need to be included in transfer_input_files . Instead of transferring just that program, we will transfer the original downloaded tar.gz file.

Before submitting, make sure to make the below additional changes to the wrapper script! Wrapper Script, part 2 \u00b6 Now that our database and BLAST software are being transferred to the job as tar.gz files, our script needs to accommodate. Opening your run_blast.sh script, add two commands at the start to un-tar the BLAST and pdbaa tar.gz files. See the previous exercise if you're not sure what these commands looks like. In order to distinguish this job from our previous job, change the output file name to something besides results.txt .

Background \u00b6 In Exercise 1.2, the wrapper script had all of the input information - the database and input file - written directly into the script. However, imagine if you wanted to run the same program on different inputs. Instead of writing new wrapper scripts for each job, you can modify the script so that some of the values are set by arguments . Using script arguments will allow you to use the same script for multiple jobs, by providing different inputs or parameters. These arguments are normally passed on the command line: But in our world of job submission, the arguments will be listed in the submit file, in the arguments line. Identifying Potential Arguments \u00b6 In the same directory as the last exercise (still logged into login04.osgconnect.net ), make sure you're in the directory with your BLAST job submission. What values might we want to input to the script via arguments? Hint: anything that we might want to change if we were to run the script many times. In this example, some values we might want to change are the name of the comparison database, the input file, and the output file. Modifying Files \u00b6 We are going to add three arguments to the wrapper script, controlling the database, input and output file. Make a copy of your last submit file and open it for editing. Add an arguments line, or uncomment the one that exists, and add the three input values mentioned above. The arguments line in your submit file should look like this: arguments = pdbaa mouse.fa results3.txt (We're using results3.txt ) to distinguish between the previous two runs.) Now go back to the wrapper script. Each scripting language (bash, perl, python, R, etc.) will have its own particular syntax for capturing command line arguments. For bash (the language of our current wrapper script), the variables $1 , $2 and $3 represent the first, second, and third arguments, respectively. Thus, in the main command of the script, replace the various names with these variables: ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin/blastx -db $1 / $1 -query $2 -out $3 If your wrapper script is in a different language, you should use that language's syntax for reading in variables from the command line. Once these changes are made, submit your jobs with condor_submit . Use condor_q -nobatch to see what the job command looks like to HTCondor. It is now easy to change the inputs for the job; we can write them into the arguments line of the submit file and they will be propagated to the command in the wrapper script. We can even turn the submit file arguments into their own variables when submitting multiple jobs at once. Readability with Variables \u00b6 One of the downsides of this approach, is that our command has become harder to read. The original script contains all the information at a glance: ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin/blastx -db pdbaa/pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out results2.txt But our new version is more cryptic -- what is $1 ?: ncbi-blast-2.10.1+/bin/blastx -db $1 -query $2 -out $3 One way to overcome this is to create our own variable names inside the wrapper script and assign the argument values to them. Here is an example for our BLAST script: #!/bin/bash DATABASE = $1 INFILE = $2 OUTFILE = $3 tar -xzf ncbi-blast-2.10.1+-x64-linux.tar.gz tar -xzf pdbaa.tar.gz ncbi-blast-2.10.1+/bin/blastx -db $DATABASE / $DATABASE -query $INFILE -out $OUTFILE Here, we are assigning the input arguments ( $1 , $2 and $3 ) to new variable names, and then using those names ( $DATABASE , $INFILE , and $OUTFILE ) in the command, which is easier to read.

This exercise should take 5-10 minutes. Background \u00b6 There is a large amount of scientific software that is available as source code. Source code is usually a group of text files (code) meant to be downloaded and then compiled into a binary file which a computer can understand. Sometimes the source code depends on other pieces of code called libraries. If the source code is linked statically , these libraries are bundled into the compilation with the source code, creating a static binary which can be run on any computer with the same operating system. Our Software Example \u00b6 For this compiling example, we will use a script written in C. C code depends on libraries and therefore will benefit from being statically linked. Our C code prints 7 rows of Pascal's triangle. Log into the OSG submit node login04.osgconnect.net . Create a directory for this exercise and cd into it. Copy and paste the following code into a file named pascal.c . #include \"stdio.h\" long factorial ( int ); int main () { int i , n , c ; n = 7 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++ ){ for ( c = 0 ; c <= ( n - i - 2 ); c ++ ) printf ( \" \" ); for ( c = 0 ; c <= i ; c ++ ) printf ( \"%ld \" , factorial ( i ) / ( factorial ( c ) * factorial ( i - c ))); printf ( \" \\n \" ); } return 0 ; } long factorial ( int n ) { int c ; long result = 1 ; for ( c = 1 ; c <= n ; c ++ ) result = result * c ; return result ; } Compiling \u00b6 In order to use this code in a job, we will first need to statically compile the code. Recall the slide from the lecture - where can we compile and where should we compile? In particular: Where is the compiler available? How computationally intensive will this compilation be? Think about these questions before moving on. Where do you think we should compile? Most linux servers (including our submit node) have the gcc (GNU compiler collection) installed, so we already have a compiler on the submit node. Furthermore, this is a simple piece of C code, so the compilation will not be computationally intensive. Thus, we should be able to compile directly on the submit node. Compile the code, using the command: username@login $ gcc -static pascal.c -o pascal Note that we have added the -static option to make sure that the compiled binary includes the necessary libraries. This will allow the code to run on any Linux machine, no matter where those libraries are located. Verify that the compiled binary was statically linked: username@login $ file pascal The Linux file command provides information about the type or kind of file that is given as an argument. In this case, you should get output like this: username@host $ file pascal pascal: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped The output clearly states that this executable (software) is statically linked. The same command run on a non-statically linked executable file would include the text dynamically linked (uses shared libs) instead. So with this simple verification step, which could even be run on files that you did not compile yourself, you have some further reassurance that it is safe to use on other Linux machines. (Bonus exercise: Try the file command on lots of other files) Submit the Job \u00b6 Now that our code is compiled, we can use it to submit a job. Think about what submit file lines we need to use to run this job: Are there input files? Are there command line arguments? Where is its output written? Based on what you thought about in 1., find a submit file from earlier that you can modify to run our compiled pascal code. Copy it to the directory with the pascal binary and make those changes. Submit the job using condor_submit . Once the job has run and left the queue, you should be able to see the results (seven rows of Pascal's triangle) in the .out file created by the job.","title":"Part2 ex1 compiling"},{"location":"materials/software/part2-ex1-compiling/#software-exercise-21-compile-statically-linked-code","text":"The goal of this exercise is to compile and statically link a piece of code and then submit it as a job.

This exercise will draw on the idea of writing a wrapper script to install and run code, first introduced in Exercise 1.2 and should take 25-30 minutes. Background \u00b6 Matlab is licensed; however, unlike most licensed software, it has the ability to be compiled and the compiled code can be run without a license. We will be compiling Matlab .m files into a binary file and running that binary using a set of files called the Matlab runtime. Matlab Code \u00b6 Log in to the CHTC submit server ( learn.chtc.wisc.edu ). Create a directory for this exercise and cd into it . Copy the following code into a file called matrix.m A = randi(100,4,4) b = randi(100,4,1); x = A*b save results.txt x -ascii Compiling Matlab Code \u00b6 The first step in making Matlab portable is compiling our Matlab script. To compile this code, we need to access the machines with the Matlab compiler installed. For this exercise, we will use the compilers installed on special CHTC build machines. In the CHTC pool, you can't use ssh to directly connect to these machines. Instead, you must submit an interactive job (similar to Exercise 2.2 ) that specifically requests these build machines. Create a file called compile.submit with the lines below: log = compile.log should_transfer_files = YES when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT transfer_input_files = matrix.m +IsBuildJob = true request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 512MB queue You can initiate the interactive job by using condor_submit 's -i option. Enter the following command: username@learn $ condor_submit -i compile.submit Make sure you've submitted this command from learn.chtc.wisc.edu ! Once the job starts, continue with the following instructions. Since you are a guest user on our system, you will need to set your HOME directory by running this command: username@build $ export HOME = $PWD The Matlab software on these build servers is accessible via modules, just like the software installed on OSG Connect. Check which modules are available and then load the older version of Matlab. username@build $ module load MATLAB/R2015b Once the module is loaded (you can check by running module list ), compile the matrix.m file with this command: username@build $ mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm matrix.m The extra arguments to the mcc command are very important here. Matlab, by default, will run on as many CPUs as it can find. This can be a big problem when running on someone else's computers, because your Matlab code might interfere with what the owner wants. The -singleCompThread option compiles the code to run on a single CPU, avoiding this problem. In addition, the -nodisplay and -nojvm options turn off the display (which won't exist where the code runs). To exit the interactive session, type exit Now that you're back on the submit server, look at the files that were created by the Matlab compiler. Which one is the compiled binary? Matlab Runtime \u00b6 The newly compiled binary will require the 2015b Matlab runtime to run. You can download the runtime from the Mathworks website and build it yourself, but to save time, for this exercise you can use the pre-built runtimes hosted by CHTC. Download the 2015b Matlab runtime hosted by CHTC: username@learn $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/r2015b.tar.gz Wrapper Script \u00b6 We will need a wrapper script to open the Matlab runtime and then run our compiled Matlab code. Our wrapper script will need to accomplish the following steps: Unpack the transferred runtime Set the environment variables Run our compiled matlab code Fortunately, the Matlab compiler has pre-written most of this wrapper script for us! Take a look at run_matrix.sh . Which of the above steps do we need to add? Once you have an idea, move to the next step. We'll need to add commands to unpack the runtime (which will have been transferred with the job). Add this line to the beginning of the run_matrix.sh file, after #!/bin/bash and the comments, but before exe_name=$0 : tar -xzf r2015b.tar.gz Look at readme.txt to determine what arguments our wrapper script requires. Once you have an idea, move to the next step. The name of the Matlab runtime directory is a required argument to the wrapper script run_matrix.sh . We'll have to do a little extra work to find out the name of that directory. Run this command tar -tf r2015b.tar.gz The output of the previous command is a list of all the files in the tar.gz file. What is the name of the first folder of the path for each file? This is the name of the runtime directory, and the argument you should pass to run_matrix.sh . Submitting the Job \u00b6 Copy an existing submit file into your current directory. The submit file we used for Exercise 2.2 example would be a good candidate, as that example also used a wrapper script. Modify your submit file for this job. Check your changes against the list below.

Introduction \u00b6 Many Python users manage their Python installation and environments with either the Anaconda or miniconda distributions. These distribution tools are great for creating portable Python installations and can be used on HTC systems with some help from a tool called conda pack . Sample Script \u00b6 For this example, create a script called rand_array.py on learn.chtc.wisc.edu or login04.osgconnect.net : import numpy as np #numpy array with random values a = np.random.rand(4,2,3) print(a) To run this script, we will need a copy of Python with the numpy library. Create and Pack a Conda Environment \u00b6 (For a generic version of these instructions, see the CHTC User Guide ) Our first step is to create a miniconda installation on the submit server. You should be logged into whichever server you made the rand_array.py script on. Download the latest Linux miniconda installer user@login $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh Run the installer to install miniconda; you'll need to accept the license terms and you can use the default installation location: [user@login]$ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh At the end, you can choose whether or not to \"initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init?\" The default is no; you would then run the eval command listed by the installer to \"activate\" Miniconda. If you choose \"no\" you'll want to save this command so that you can reactivate the Miniconda installation when needed in the future. Next we'll create our conda \"environment\" with numpy (we've called the environment \"py3-numpy\"): (base) [user@login]$ conda create -n py3-numpy (base) [user@login]$ conda activate py3-numpy (py3-numpy) [user@login]$ conda install numpy Once everything is installed, deactivate the environment to go back to the Miniconda \"base\" environment. (py3-numpy) [user@login]$ conda deactivate We'll now install a tool that will pack up the just created conda environment so we can run it elsewhere. Make sure that your job's Miniconda environment is created, but deactivated, so that you're in the \"base\" Miniconda environment, then run: (base) [user@login]$ conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack Enter y when it asks you to install. Finally, we will run the conda pack command, which will automatically create a tar.gz file with our environment: (base) [user@login]$ conda pack -n py3-numpy Submit a Job \u00b6 The executable for this job will need to be a wrapper script. What steps do you think need to be included? Write down a rough draft, then compare with the following script. Create a wrapper script like the following: #!/bin/bash set -e export PATH mkdir py3-numpy tar -xzf py3-numpy.tar.gz -C py3-numpy . py3-numpy/bin/activate python3 rand_array.py What needs to be included in your submit file for the job to run successfully? Try yourself and then check the suggestions in the next point. In your submit file, make sure to have the following: Your executable should be the the bash script you created in the previous step.

This guide shows how to use pre-existing containers to run jobs on the OSG. One caveat for using containers: not all systems will support them. HTCondor has built-in features for using Docker and many OSG resources have Singularity installed, but they are not always available everywhere. Setup \u00b6 Make sure you are logged into login04.osgconnect.net (the OSG Connect submit server for this workshop). For this exercise we will be using Singularity containers that are hosted by OSG Connect. Default Environment \u00b6 First, let's run a job without a container to see what the typical job environment is. Create a bash script with the following lines: #!/bin/bash hostname cat /etc/os-release gcc --version This will print out the version of Linux on the computer and the version of gcc , a common software compiler. Copy a submit file from a previous OSG Connect job and edit it so that the script you just wrote is the executable. Submit the job and read the standard output file when it finishes.

Sample Script and Access Point \u00b6 This example uses the same script, rand_array.py as Exercise 2.5 This exercise must be run on learn.chtc.wisc.edu Getting Set Up \u00b6 Before building your own Docker container, you need to go through the following set up steps: Install Docker Dekstop on your computer. Docker Desktop page You may need to create a Docker Hub user name to download Docker Desktop; if not created at that step, create a user name for Docker Hub now. (Optional): Once Docker is up and running on your computer, you are welcome to take some time to explore the basics of downloading and running a container, as shown in the initial sections of this Docker lesson: Introduction to Docker However, this isn't strictly necessary for building your own container. Building a Container \u00b6 In order to make our container reproducible, we will be using Docker's capability to build a container image from a specification file. First, create an empty build directory on your computer , not the CHTC or OSG submit servers. In the build directory, create a file called Dockerfile (no file extension!) with the following contents: # Start with this image as a \"base\". # It's as if all the commands that created that image were inserted here. # Always use a specific tag like \"4.10.3\", never \"latest\"! # The version referenced by \"latest\" can change, so the build will be # more stable when building from a specific version tag. FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.10.3 # Use RUN to execute commands inside the image as it is being built up. RUN conda install --yes numpy # RUN multiple commands together. # Try to always \"clean up\" after yourself to reduce the final size of your image. RUN apt-get update \\ && apt-get --yes install --no-install-recommends graphviz \\ && apt-get --yes clean \\ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* This is our specification file and provides Docker with the information it needs to build our new container. There are other options besides FROM and RUN ; see the Docker documentation for more information. Note that our container is starting from an existing container continuumio/miniconda3:4.10.3 . This container is produced by the continuumio organization; the number 4.10.3 indicates the container version. When we create our new container, we will want to use a similar naming scheme of: USERNAME/CONTAINER:VERSIONTAG In what follows, you will want to replace USERNAME with your DockerHub user name. The CONTAINER name and VERSIONTAG are your choice; in what follows, we will use py3-numpy as the container name and 2021-08 as the version tag. To build and name the new container, open a command line window on your computer where you can run Docker commands. Use the cd command to change your working directory to the build directory with the Dockerfile inside. $ docker build -t USERNAME/py3-numpy:2021-08 . Note the . at the end of the command! This indicates that we're using the current directory as our build environment, including the Dockerfile inside. Upload Container and Submit Job \u00b6 Right now the container image only exists on your computer. To use it in CHTC or elsewhere, it needs to be added to a public registry like Docker Hub. To put your container image in Docker Hub, use the docker push command on the command line: $ docker push USERNAME/py3-numpy:2021-08 If the push doesn't work, you may need to run docker login first, enter your Docker Hub username and password and then try the push again.

To complete it, you will have to find and fix several issues. Be patient, keep trying, but if you really get stuck, you can ask for help or look at the very bottom of this page for a link to answers. But try not to look at the answers! Acquiring the Materials \u00b6 We have prepared some Python code, data, and submit files for this exercise: Log into an Access Point Download a tarball of the materials: user@server $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool21/troubleshooting.tar.gz Extract the tarball using the commands that you learned earlier Change into the newly extracted directory and explore its contents \u2014 resist the temptation to fix things right away! Solving a Project Euler Problem \u00b6 The contents of the tarball contain a series of submit files, Python scripts, and an input file that are designed to solve Project Euler problem 98 : By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36^2. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96^2. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter. Using p098_words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself). What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair? NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file. Unfortunately, there are many issues with the submit files that you will have to work through before you can you can obtain the solution to the problem! The code in the Python scripts themselves is, in theory, free of bugs. Finding anagrams \u00b6 The first step in our workflow takes an input file with a list of words ( p098_words.txt ) and extracts all of the anagrams using the find_anagrams.py script. Naturally, we want to run this as an HTCondor job, so: Submit the accompanying find-anagrams.sub file from the tarball. Resolve any issues that you encounter until the job returns pairs of anagrams as its output. Once you have satisfactory output, move onto the next section. Please be polite Submit hosts are shared resources, so you should clean up after yourself. If you discover any jobs in the Hold state, and after you are done troubleshooting them, remove them with the following command: user@server $ condor_rm -const 'JobStatus =?= 5' <JOB FILTER> Where replacing <JOB FILTER> with... Will remove... Your username (e.g. blin ) All of your held jobs A cluster ID (e.g. 74078 ) All held jobs matching the given cluster ID A job ID (e.g. 97932.30 ) That specific held job Finding the largest square \u00b6 The next step in the workflow uses the max_square.py script to find the largest square number, if any, for a given anagram word pair. Let's submit jobs that run max_square.py for all of the anagram word pairs (i.e., one job per word pair), that you found in the previous section: Submit the accompanying squares.sub file from the tarball Resolve any issues that you encounter until you receive output for each job. Note that some jobs may have empty output since not all anagram word pairs are square anagram word pairs. Next, you can find the largest square among your output by directly using the command line. For example, if all of your job output has been placed in the squares directory and are named square-1.out , square-2.out , etc., then you could run the following command to find the largest square: user@server $ cat squares/square-*.out | sort -n | tail -n 1 You can check if you have the right answer with any of the OSG staff or by submitting the answer to Project Euler (requires an account).

For example, if all of your job output has been placed in the squares directory and are named square-1.out , square-2.out , etc., then you could run the following command to find the largest square: user@server $ cat squares/square-*.out | sort -n | tail -n 1 You can check if you have the right answer with any of the OSG staff or by submitting the answer to Project Euler (requires an account).","title":"Finding the largest square"},{"location":"materials/troubleshooting/part1-ex1-troubleshooting/#answer-key","text":"There is also a working solution on our web server that can be retrieved with user@server $ wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool21/troubleshooting-key.tar.gz It contains comments labeled SOLUTION that you can consult in case you get stuck.

What is DAGMan? \u00b6 In short, DAGMan lets you submit complex sequences of jobs as long as they can be expressed as a directed acylic graph. For example, you may wish to run a large parameter sweep but before the sweep run you need to prepare your data. After the sweep runs, you need to collate the results. This might look like this, assuming you want to sweep over five parameters: DAGMan has many abilities, such as throttling jobs, recovery from failures, and more. More information about DAGMan can be found at in the HTCondor manual . Submitting a Simple DAG \u00b6 For our job, we will return briefly to the sleep program. executable = /bin/sleep arguments = 4 log = simple.log output = simple.out error = simple.error request_memory = 1GB request_disk = 1GB request_cpus = 1 queue We are going to get a bit more sophisticated in submitting our jobs now. Let's have three windows open. In one window, you'll submit the job. In another you will watch the queue, and in the third you will watch what DAGMan does. First we will create the most minimal DAG that can be created: a DAG with just one node. Put this into a file named simple.dag .

Let\u2019s make pretty pictures! We have a small program that draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set. You can read about the Mandelbrot set on Wikipedia , or you can simply appreciate the pretty pictures. It\u2019s a fractal. We have a simple program that can draw the Mandelbrot set. It's called goatbrot . Before beginning, ensure that you are connected to learn.chtc.wisc.edu . Create a directory for this exercise and cd into it. Running goatbrot From the Command Line \u00b6 You can generate the Mandelbrot set as a quick test with two simple commands. Generate a PPM image of the Mandelbrot set: username@learn $ goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c 0 ,0 -w 3 -s 1000 ,1000 The goatbroat program takes several parameters. Let's break them down: -i 1000 The number of iterations. Bigger numbers generate more accurate images but are slower to run. -o tile_000000_000000.ppm The output file to generate. -c 0,0 The center point of the image. Here it is the point (0,0). -w 3 The width of the image. Here is 3. -s 1000,1000 The size of the final image. Here we generate a picture that is 1000 pixels wide and 1000 pixels tall. Convert the image to the JPEG format (using a built-in program called convert ): username@learn $ convert tile_000000_000000.ppm mandel.jpg Dividing the Work into Smaller Pieces \u00b6 The Mandelbrot set can take a while to create, particularly if you make the iterations large or the image size large. What if we broke the creation of the image into multiple invocations (an HTC approach!) then stitched them together? Once we do that, we can run each goatbroat in parallel in our cluster. Here's an example you can run by hand. Run goatbroat 4 times: username@learn $ goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c -0.75,0.75 -w 1 .5 -s 500 ,500 username@learn $ goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000001.ppm -c 0 .75,0.75 -w 1 .5 -s 500 ,500 username@learn $ goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000001_000000.ppm -c -0.75,-0.75 -w 1 .5 -s 500 ,500 username@learn $ goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000001_000001.ppm -c 0 .75,-0.75 -w 1 .5 -s 500 ,500 Stitch the small images together into the complete image (in JPEG format): username@learn $ montage tile_000000_000000.ppm tile_000000_000001.ppm tile_000001_000000.ppm tile_000001_000001.ppm -mode Concatenate -tile 2x2 mandel.jpg This will produce the same image as above. We divided the image space into a 2\u00d72 grid and ran goatbrot on each section of the grid. The built-in montage program stitches the files together and writes out the final image in JPEG format. View the Image! \u00b6 Run the commands above so that you have the Mandelbrot image. When you create the image, you might wonder how you can view it. If you're comfortable with scp or another method, you can copy it back to your computer to view it. Otherwise you can view it in your web browser in three easy steps: Make your web directory (you only need to do this once): username@learn $ cd ~ username@learn $ mkdir public_html username@learn $ chmod 0711 . username@learn $ chmod 0755 public_html Copy the image into your web directory (the below command assumes you're back in the directory where you created mandel.jpg): username@learn $ cp mandel.jpg ~/public_html/ Access http://learn.chtc.wisc.edu/~<USERNAME>/mandel.jpg in your web browser (change <USERNAME> to your username on learn.chtc.wisc.edu , keeping the ~ ).","title":"Part1 ex2 mandelbrot"},{"location":"materials/workflows/part1-ex2-mandelbrot/#workflows-exercise-12-a-brief-detour-through-the-mandelbrot-set","text":"Before we explore using DAGs to implement workflows, let\u2019s get a more interesting job.

Make Your Job Submission Files \u00b6 We'll run our goatbrot example. If you didn't read about it yet, please do so now . We are going to make a DAG with four simultaneous jobs ( goatbrot ) and one final node to stitch them together ( montage ). This means we have five jobs. We're going to run goatbrot with more iterations (100,000) so each job will take longer to run. You can create your five jobs.
