Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison During the School, July 25\u201329, you could learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 at your own campus or using the national-scale OSG \u2014 to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. The school is ideal for graduate students in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff (especially staff who perform research or support/facilitate researchers). People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 We plan to accept applications from about mid-March through mid-April. Check here for a link to the application system. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG User School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
